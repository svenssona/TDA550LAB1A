# OOP Design in Java: Vehicle Simulator 

## About
School project learning Object Oriented Programming. Applying Design Patterns and Principles to refactor and build a toy vehicle simulator.

This vehicle simulator focuses on building a good programming project from a design standpoint. We wanted the project to be extensible and flexible 
so that further implementations easly could be done. 

This project for example uses the Model-View-Controll-Application (MVCA) and Observer pattern in a clear and precise way. 

### UML
For a more detailed overview please look at the **plannedUML.pdf** ![here](https://github.com/svenssona/TDA550LAB1A/blob/main/plannedUML.pdf). 
This the our 'end' product for this project. We did a refactoring from **currentUML.pdf**.
